# cp-dojos-service

## About

This is the Dojos service, a backend repository of the [CoderDojo Zen Community Platform](https://github.com/CoderDojo/community-platform) project. The service looks after the Dojos (coding club) section of the API (anything to do with retrieving data/information to do with Dojos).

If you want to get set up to make a backend contribution, please see the [cp-local-development repository](https://github.com/CoderDojo/cp-local-development).

General documentation is in the [community-platform repository](https://github.com/CoderDojo/community-platform).

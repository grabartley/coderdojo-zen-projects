# cp-projects-service

This is a prototype of the projects microservice for the CoderDojo Zen platform. This microservice is expected to handle:


  * Runtimes of projects of the following types:
    * Python
    * JavaScript (using NodeJS)
    * HTML/CSS/JavaScript (using GitHub)
  * Version control for projects using GitHub
  * Creation/Update/Deletion of projects
  * Project statistic tracking
  
  
Once this prototype satisfies it's requirements, I will integrate it into the existing Zen stack to work alongside the other microservices.

# CoderDojo Zen Projects

This project aims to build a project creation, management and interaction solution for the CoderDojo Foundation and their community platform (Zen) which is currently used to manage over 1,000 Dojos and their events across the world. This solution allows youths to share software projects they have worked on by uploading their code which is automatically stored and versioned using GitHub. Projects can then be run and interacted with directly in the browser including Python 3, Node.js, HTML5 and Java projects.

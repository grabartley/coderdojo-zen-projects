# CoderDojo Zen Projects

This project is a complete project creation, management and interaction solution for the CoderDojo Foundation (CDF) and their community platform [Zen](https://zen.coderdojo.com/). This solution allows youths to share software projects they have worked on by uploading their code which is automatically stored and versioned using GitHub. Projects can then be run and interacted with directly in the browser including Python 3, Node.js, HTML5 and Java projects.

I used Pivotal Tracker to keep track of tasks for the project. My tracker can be found [here](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2122879).

# CoderDojo Zen Projects

Last Summer, for my INTRA placement, I worked with the CoderDojo Foundation (CDF). Towards the end of my placement I was approached by them and asked if I would like to work on this project for their community platform, which is called Zen.

The main focus of my project is to create an easily extendable browser runtime environment in JavaScript which will support various different programming languages and integrate this into the existing Zen architecture in order to facilitate the running of code from projects created by youths on the platform. The languages I will be supporting runtime for are Python, JavaScript and possibly Scratch or Java as stretch goals since these are the most popular languages used by youths in Dojos.

I will also be extending the functionality of Zen to allow youths to be able to upload their project code and I will be storing it with versioning using an existing version control system which will be abstracted away from the user. In addition to this, I will be tracking statistics relating to these projects and making them available to the CDF through an admin panel. I will also be handling project management by different user types and organizing of projects based on their content, level, language etc. in order to facilitate searching for projects and linking of projects to certain CoderDojo learning resources.

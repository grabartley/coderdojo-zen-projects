# User Evaluation Results and Conclusions

Documentation of my two user evaluations can be found here. I have split it into the following folders:

  * **general-users**: questions, results and conclusions from my second user evaluation which focused on gathering feedback from users of different types who interacted directly with my live system.
  * **mockups**: user interface mockups which I showed to ninjas (youths in CoderDojo) during the first user evaluation.
  * **ninjas**: results and conclusions from my first user evaluation which focused on gathering feedback from ninjas in CoderDojo DCU on my user interface mockups at an early stage in the project.

# Testing Documentation

I have included documentation of the testing I carried out as part of this project here. It is broken down into two folders.

  * **code-coverage**: automatically generated documents detailing the coverage of my code in cp-projects-frontend and cp-projects-service from unit and integration testing.
  * **user-evaluation**: manually written documents detailing the results and conclusions from my two user evaluations.

## First Draft Functional Specification
#### 14th November 2017

This week I worked on writing a first draft of my functional specification. I didn't make as much progress with it as I would have liked due to working on assignments for other modules and lab work. However, I did finish the first and fourth sections including a high level System Architecture diagram which I spent a lot of my time working on:

Although I said I wouldn't continue the UI mockups for a while, I decided to fill in what I could for now for the "New Project Creation Page" so that I would have a better idea of exactly what areas of it I am unsure on. My mockup from this week can be seen below:

This week I am continuing my first draft of the functional specification and will have more time to dedicate to it. I am aiming to have the first draft finished by next week.

## More UI Mockups & First User Stories
#### 6th November 2017

Last week I worked on creating some more UI mockups and writing user stories. I didn't make as much progress with the UI mockups as I would have liked but I did spend a lot of my time writing and prioritising user stories on my project tracker which can be found here: [My project tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/2122879). My new UI mockups can be seen following:

**Edit Profile Page - Your Projects Section (Logged in)**

**New Project Creation Page (Logged in) - WIP**

Clearly, the "New Project Creation Page" is still work in progress (WIP) and this is because I haven't yet decided on how privacy settings for projects are going to work. This brought me to the decision that I am going to focus more on research and completing my functional specification this week so that I can better define these kinds of details. Once I have clear decisions on implementation for the important aspects of my project I will return to the UI mockups.

With regard to user stories, I created and prioritised 13 user stories for the persona of Niamh this week. I also created a number of chores on my tracker for myself to complete as part of my research phase and beyond so that I have a clearer focus and prioritisation when it comes to my research.

In addition to this, I realised that I had missed a user type when creating my personas. I had not considered a CoderDojo Foundation employee as a user type. In order to provide for this user type, I created the following new persona:

  * **Paul (CDF Employee)**: Paul is 26 years old. He is a member of the community team at the CoderDojo Foundation. As part of his job, he wants to onboard a lot of new members to Zen and ensure that current users are engaging with Zen and enjoying their experiences with it. In order to do his job effectively, he needs statistics from Zen and administrative abilities over content existing on Zen.

This week, as I have said, I will be focusing on research and writing my functional specification which is due on the 24th of November. By shifting my focus to these things, I feel that I will be better able to make decisions to reduce the amount of unknowns in my project now and then focus on implementation and testing.

## Project Approval & Next Steps
#### 29th October 2017

I had my approval panel session on Monday 23rd October and after discussing my project with the panel, it was approved. I was also given some useful feedback to consider throughout the year as I work on it. This is the main feedback I was given:

  * **Languages**: The release date of Scratch 3 being an unknown poses a major risk for the project, I should focus on implementing runtime for Python well instead of focusing on Scratch. Once one language is well supported and the runtime is abstracted enough, other languages are not completely necessary.
  * **Testing**: Focus on testing throughout the project and not just towards the end, both technical and user-oriented.
  * **Demonstration**: When it comes to demonstrating my project I should showcase the lifecycle of using my project from each user's perspective.

Following on from my approval session, I decided to continue drawing up some early user interface (UI) mockups I have been working on for the past few weeks. Once they are finished I will be able to show them to potential users and the CoderDojo Foundation (CDF) for feedback. These are the ones I have drawn up so far which are early concepts and will certainly change as the project goes on:

**Project Page (Logged in)**

**My Projects - Parent Perspective (Logged in)**

**Dojo Page Projects Section**

I have also decided to create personas for each user type I will need to consider when working on the project. These will become useful when writing user stories and will ensure my project is always designed with it's users in mind. The personas I have created are as follows:

  * **Niamh (Youth)**: Niamh is 12 years old. She has been attending her local Dojo for three years since the age of 9. She started out by attending Scratch sessions and then moved on to Web Design and more recently Python. She works on coding projects in her spare time with her friends and showcased some of her work at the Coolest Projects event in the RDS in Dublin, Ireland in 2017.
  * **Steven (Parent)**: Steve is 34 years old. He is the father of two children, one of which is Niamh. He is a radio show host and doesn't like to use computers much in his spare time out of personal preference. However, he does support his daughter's passion for technology and has a Zen account for this reason.
  * **Allie (Mentor)**: Allie is 21 years old. She has been a mentor at her local Dojo for two years now teaching the youths Scratch, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. She is in her final year studying in university and has a part-time job in a clothing shop. She volunteered to help run Coolest Projects 2017.
  * **Chris (Champion)**: Chris is 52 years old. He is the champion of his own Dojo which he set up five years ago. He has worked in the technology industry his whole life and is now a product manager for a major software company. He is passionate about teaching youths how to code and promoting interest in technology at an early age.

Using these personas I can then begin to write user stories which I will be keeping track of using my own project board on [Pivotal Tracker - an agile software development tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/). I have shared this board with my project supervisor and with relevant members of the CoderDojo Foundation so that they will all be kept up-to-date on my progress with the project. Writing these stories and continuing to create UI mockups will be what I focus on for the next week.
